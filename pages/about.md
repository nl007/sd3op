### About Us

Members of the Fraternities of St Dominic are lay men and women who are fully incorporated members of the Order of Preachers and live out their Dominican vocation in the world. Lay Dominicans, who in the past have been called Third Order Tertiaries, have existed almost as long as the Dominican order itself. The Lay Fraternities of St Dominic was founded with their own rule in 1285 and was officially recognized by the Church on the feast of St Thomas Aquinas in 1286.

Lay Dominicans are required to pray the Divine Office (morning, evening, and night prayer), pray a daily rosary, and attend daily Mass, if possible.

Lay Dominicans come from every background, joining the Dominican charism to their state of life in the world. As members of the Order, they participate in its apostolic mission through prayer, study, and and sharing the Faith through their unique gifts according to the state proper to the laity.
