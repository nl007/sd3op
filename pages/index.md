  In a powerful and compelling way, St. Dominic proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the men and women of his time.
  To be effective instruments of Our Lord, we must live lives centered on Him. We must, as Saint Dominic did, bring Christ’s redemptive grace to our times by our own witness to the Word in life and action, keeping in mind that our apostolic activity flows from the fullness of prayer and contemplation.
  As Lay Dominicans responding to His grace, we are called to be attentive to the Spirit, to study Sacred Truth, to know Church doctrine, and to collaborate with our entire Dominican Family in order to proclaim the Word of God.

### Who we are

The St Dominic Chapter of San Diego meets monthly on the 3rd Thursday of the month at [Catholic Answers](https://catholic.com) in El Cajon, CA. We share a communal dinner at 6:30pm, chant vespers at 7:00pm and continue with a short business meeting and study. We complete the evening with compline and singing the Salve Regina.
